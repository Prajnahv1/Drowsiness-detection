# Drowsiness-detection

The project implements an AI-based drowsiness detection system using  
computer vision and machine learning techniques. It leverages a pre-trained  
dlib facial landmark predictor to detect and analyze the user's eyes in real-time  
through a webcam. The system calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to  
monitor eye blinks and determine drowsiness. If the EAR falls below a  
defined threshold for a specified number of consecutive frames, an alert is  
triggered. This alert is both visual, displayed on the video frame, and auditory,  
using the pyttsx3 text-to-speech engine to warn the user. The system is  
designed to help prevent accidents by alerting users when they show signs of drowsiness.

Enhance Road Safety: Develop a system that significantly reduces the risk of  
accidents caused by driver fatigue by providing real-time monitoring and  
alerts. 
• Accurate Detection: Implement algorithms capable of accurately detecting  
early signs of drowsiness using various indicators such as eye movement,  
head position, and yawning frequency. 
• Real-Time Processing: Ensure the system can process data and provide  
feedback in real time to enable timely intervention and prevent accidents. 
• User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for  
drivers to interact with the system without causing distraction. 
• High Reliability and Precision: Achieve high reliability and precision in  
drowsiness detection under various driving conditions and for different  
drivers. 
• Integration with Vehicle Systems: Facilitate seamless integration with  
existing vehicle systems to leverage data from in-car sensors and cameras.
Cost-Effectiveness: Create a cost-effective solution that can be widely  
implemented in consumer vehicles without significantly increasing production costs
